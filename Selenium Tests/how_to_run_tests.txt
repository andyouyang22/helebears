First, you must download and install the Selenium IDE for Firefox here:
http://www.seleniumhq.org/download/

Allow Firefox to install the addons.
Next, go into Tools -> Selenium IDE to start the IDE
Load the test suite inside of the Selenium Tests folder called:
'UI Tests with Selinium'

The number of tests will then pop up into Selenium.
Set the scroller to slowest to ensure ample time for the server to send data and for everything to render.

Select play-all to run all of the tests
