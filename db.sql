Readings and lectures explore specific constellations of theory and practice in relation to changing social and historical conditions. The course follows the rise of modernist design thinking, with particular emphasis on the growing influence of technical rationality across multiple fields in the post World War II period. Systematic approaches based in cybernetics and operations research (amongst others) are examined in the context of wider attempts to develop a science of design. Challenges to modernist design thinking, through advocacy planning and community-based design, the influence of social movements and countercultures, and parallel developments in postmodernism within and beyond architecture, provide the critical background for consideration of recent approaches to design theory, including those informed by developments in digital media and technology, environmental and ecological concerns, questions surrounding the globalization of architectural production, and the development of new materials.	{"Architecture 11B":11,"Architecture 100A":8,"Architecture 279":8,"Architecture 239":11,"Architecture 249":8,"Architecture 259":2,"Architecture 139":5,"Architecture 170A":1}	2015-11-25 01:59:03.581-08	2015-12-07 00:19:05.996-08

In this course we will cover various aspects relating to host-pathogen interactions, focusing on animals and their bacterial pathogens. We will address the ecology of host-pathogen interactions, their shaping by co-evolution, examine prominent molecular mechanisms taking part in this warfare and learn how ancient mechanisms are used and reused through millions of years of evolution. The course will examine how better understanding of host-pathogen interactions can suggest new strategies for fighting infectious diseases.	{"Integrative Biology C105":4,"Integrative Biology C82":2,"Integrative Biology 160":6,"Integrative Biology 158LF":6,"Integrative Biology C125L":7,"Integrative Biology 154":3,"Integrative Biology 35AC":4,"Integrative Biology 159":5,"Integrative Biology C144":7}	2015-11-25 16:00:13.551-08	2015-12-07 00:19:06.276-08

It will deal with the emergence of identifiable Muslim communities throughout the U.S. and focus on patterns of migration, the ethnic makeup of such communities, gender dynamics, political identity, and cases of conversion to Islam. The course will spend considerable time on the African American, Indo-Pakistani, and Arab American Muslim communities since they constitute the largest groupings. It also examines in depth the emergence of national, regional, and local Muslim institutions, patterns of development pursued by a number of them, and levels of cooperation or antagonism. The course seeks an examination of gender relations and dynamics across the various Muslim groupings, and the internal and external factors that contribute to real and imagined crisis. The course seeks to conduct and document the growth and expansion of mosques, schools, and community centers in the greater Bay Area. Finally, no class on Islam in America would be complete without a critical examination of the impacts of 9/11 on Muslim communities, the erosion of civil rights, and the ongoing war on terrorism.	{"Asian American Studies R2A":1,"Asian American Studies R2B":9,"Asian American Studies 172":4,"Asian American Studies 20AC":7,"Asian American Studies 122":5}	2015-11-25 02:02:32.512-08	2015-12-07 00:19:06.069-08

It will adopt a broad-based approach to explore the concepts of stress, health, and disease, with a particular focus on current primary literature. The course will cover multiple dimensions in the study of stress, which employ genetic, epigenetic, molecular, cellular, physiological, and cognitive approaches, especially in the context of endocrine and neuroscience research. We will analyze the individual response to stress, how genetic and environmental factors play a role in it, how it translates to physiological and mental health and well-being vs. pathological conditions, and put that in a public health perspective.	{"Integrative Biology 118":5,"Integrative Biology C105":9,"Integrative Biology C82":8,"Integrative Biology 160":5,"Integrative Biology 158LF":7,"Integrative Biology C125L":9,"Integrative Biology 154":11,"Integrative Biology 35AC":9,"Integrative Biology 159":1,"Integrative Biology C144":6}	2015-11-25 16:00:54.078-08	2015-12-07 00:19:06.608-08

We study Chinese theater in the context of pleasure precincts, ad hoc markets, ritual parades, and printed matter. The underlying questions we ask are: how did different kinds of spatial structure historically define performance? And how did these varied spatial configurations orient the relationship of the audience to the performance differently? And what general implications did the theatrical space have for the constitution of the self and for social formation in medieval and early modern China?	{"Chinese 1Y":7,"Chinese 1A":7,"Chinese 7A":8,"Chinese 102":2,"Chinese 1X":2,"Chinese 100YA":2,"Chinese 100XA":1,"Chinese 172":4,"Chinese 158":5}	2015-11-25 02:24:49.122-08	2015-12-07 00:19:06.074-08

Writing in what might be called the “pre disciplinary” period of the modern social sciences, their works cross the boundaries of anthropology, economics, history, political science, sociology, and are today claimed by these and other disciplines as essential texts. We will read intensively and critically from their respective works, situating their intellectual contributions in the history of social transformations wrought by industrialization and urbanization, political revolution, and the development of modern consumer society.	{"Interdisciplinary Studies Field Major 100F":9,"Interdisciplinary Studies Field Major C145":9}	2015-11-25 16:03:24.869-08	2015-12-07 00:19:06.98-08

At issue among scholars working within different research traditions are core disagreements about what should be studied (institutions, texts, audiences, technologies), how they should be studied, and even what constitutes an "effect." Course readings and lectures stress an understanding of different empirical and critical research traditions by focusing on the social, political, and historical contexts surrounding them, the research models and methods they employ, as well as the findings and conclusions they have reached. Course assignments and exams assess student understanding of course readings as well as the ability to apply mass media theory to new media texts.	{"Media Studies 10":4,"Media Studies 130":6}	2015-11-25 16:47:11.875-08	2015-12-07 00:19:06.184-08

Noblewomen's diaries, poetry anthologies, and selections from the Tale of Genji offer a window into that culture. We examine how oral culture and high literary art mix in Kamakura period tales and explore representations of heroism in military chronicles and medieval Noh drama. After considering the linked verse of late medieval times, we read vernacular literature from the urban culture of the Edo period. No previous course work in Japanese literature, history, or language is expected.	{"Japanese 1A":6,"Japanese 10X":4,"Japanese 10A":5,"Japanese 120":2,"Japanese 163":10,"Japanese C115":2,"Japanese C141":2,"Japanese 101":5,"Japanese 100A":1}	2015-11-25 16:08:21.785-08	2015-12-07 00:19:07.054-08

In particular, we will look at the effects of massive migration flows--due to globalization processes--on the national culture of the core countries and examine the ways in which particular national cultures react to the increasing multiculturization of Europe. The goal of the course is, first of all, to familiarize students with a variety of cultural, social, and political innovations that accompany the formation of multicultural Europe. This involves (1) an examination of the traditional concepts of nationhood and citizenship, and (2)a study of the Europeanization of culture.	{"Interdisciplinary Studies Field Major 100F":1}	2015-11-25 16:03:38.415-08	2015-12-07 00:19:07.313-08

The course explores the development of a range of experimental film forms and practices, situating them in relation to the larger artistic, social, and intellectual contexts in which they arise. We look at the ways artists have not only created new film languages in order to epress their unique ideas and vision, but also how they inverted alternative modes of production, distribution, and exhibition for their work. We examine the major formal modes of Avant-Garde cinema, moving between historical and current developments. These include abstract, surrealist/Dada, psychodrama, the lyric film-poem, autobiographical, materialist and structural forms, political and activst, new narrative, recycled cinema, the film essay, feminist and queer cinemas, as well as expanded forms such as installation and web based cinema.	{"Film and Media R1B":4,"Film and Media 140":5,"Film and Media 20":2,"Film and Media 25B":11,"Film and Media 180B":11,"Film and Media 240":2,"Film and Media 151":5}	2015-11-25 12:32:26.623-08	2015-12-07 00:19:06.533-08

Our stress will be on post-Marxist works of analysis. The initial focal point will be on the work of Max Weber and Joseph Schumpeter, as well as important current debates in economic history and social theory generated by their work. Both Weber and Schumpeter display a strong fascination and elaboration with the work of Marx. The way they analyze Marx is very revealing about the way contemporary analysts seek to understand the capitalist system. We will also consider a number of current efforts that look at the systemic nature of capitalism. In particular, we are interested in how economic historians now see the development of capitalism. We also want to examine the Weberian tradition in terms of the role of culture in shaping economic behavior. Debates about the nature of globalization will also be considered as well as analysis of the changing nature of work.	{"Interdisciplinary Studies Field Major C145":2}	2015-11-25 16:03:32.421-08	2015-12-07 00:19:06.773-08

The course emphasizes a regression model approach and discusses disease incidence modeling and both continuous outcome data/linear models and longitudinal extensions to nonlinear models (e.g., logistic and Poisson). The primary focus is from the analysis side, but mathematical intuition behind the procedures will also be discussed.

Yet few of us pay attention to its distinctive traits and to its effects beyond our borders. California may be "a state of mind," but it is also the most dynamic place in the most powerful country in the world, and would be the 8th largest economy if it were a country. Its wealth has been built on mining, agriculture, industry, trade, and finance. Natural abundance and geographic advantage have played their parts, but the state's greatest resource has been its wealth and diversity of people, who have made it a center of technological and cultural innovation from Hollywood to Silicon Valley. Yet California has a dark side of exploitation and racialization.	{"Geography 171":7,"Geography C32":5,"Geography 183":3,"Geography 147":10,"Geography 159AC":3,"Geography 10":1,"Geography 40":4,"Geography C152":11}	2015-11-25 15:36:29.729-08	2015-12-07 00:19:06.847-08

In turn, life asserts a vast influence on the abiotic components; in fact, the biosphere itself is a crucial system component.

Because the field of media studies has historical roots in both the social sciences and humanities, the course will cover both quantitative and qualitative approaches to communications research. Course readings will describe research methods, offer examples of research projects and findings, and present critiques of research studies and methods. Course assignments will involve designing and conducting a series of sample projects on a single topic of the student's choosing in order to gain a fuller understanding of various research methods and their limitations and strengths.

Its central problems - What is perception? What is the nature of perceptual consciousness? How can one fit an account of perceptual experience into a broader account of the nature of the mind and the world? - are problems at the heart of metaphysics. It is often justifiably said that the theory of perception (and especially vision) is the area of psychology and neuroscience that has made the greatest progress in recent years. Despite this progress, or perhaps because of it, philosophical problems about perception retain a great urgency, both for philosophy and for science.	{"Philosophy 2":2,"Philosophy 12A":8,"Philosophy 7":2,"Philosophy 190":1,"Philosophy 176":1,"Philosophy 116":9,"Philosophy 25A":4,"Philosophy 108":11,"Philosophy 146":6}	2015-11-25 17:12:09.584-08	2015-12-07 00:19:07.714-08

Modernity was understood in three ways. It concerned the development of a capitalist economy based on the use of science to develop new technology, the emergence of states with bureaucracies allied with military organizations, and the decline of religious authority as the main arbiter of moral values accompanied by the rise of the model of the self-interested purposive actor. Social theory was produced not just to create an understanding of these changes and the problems they caused, but also to be used to propose how society ought to be structured. In this class, we examine how classical thinkers, like Karl Marx, Max Weber, and Emile Durkheim among others, proposed how to analyze those changes and in doing so created theories of society.	{"Sociology 166":8,"Sociology 116":2,"Sociology 150":4,"Sociology 101":1,"Sociology 7":11,"Sociology 5":2,"Sociology C115":10,"Sociology 121":9,"Sociology 127":3,"Sociology 160":1,"Sociology 119S":3,"Sociology 271A":8,"Sociology 280Q":3,"Sociology 280B":4,"Sociology 120":7,"Sociology C126":10}	2015-12-06 16:19:14.705-08	2015-12-07 00:19:08.287-08
